      Two versions of this algorithm exist: a deterministic version that enumerates all permutations until it hits a sorted
      one,[2][4] and a randomized version that randomly permutes its input. An analogy for the working of the latter version
      is to sort a deck of cards by throwing the deck into the air, picking the cards up at random, and repeating the process
      until the deck is sorted. Its name is a portmanteau of the words bogus and sort.[5]
